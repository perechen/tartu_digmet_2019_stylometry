## Introduction to stylometry and multivariate text analysis in R
  
These are materials for the stylometry workshop (Digital Methods in Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Tartu, August 26-29, 2019

Workshop extensively uses ["stylo"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stylo/stylo.pdf) R package, and [tidy text mining](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) philosophy.
  
It relies on datasets from [**Computational Stylistics Group**](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/resources/) and [**All the news**](https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news/) dataset by Andrew Thompson 

Code description:
  
1. Two lines of code for calling **stylo()** and managing results;
2. Replication of distance calculations and hierarchical clustering with R and tidytext;
3. Bruteforce lazy SVM for predicting political "bias" in media;
4. Iterative SVM to check dispersion of results (loops are working better when running in .Rmd)  
  
 Slides include introduction to stylometry and distances & "stylo" package guide
